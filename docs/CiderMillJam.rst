Cider Mill Jam
===============================

The Cider Mill Jam is a weekly  Jam for singers and acoustic players of all abilities.
It draws a mix of complete beginners, folks who have been doing this for a while and a
few who get regularly paid for making music.
The only requirement is a willingness to share the airspace with your fellow musicians.

During the NFL season we play ::

   6:00pm to 9:00pm 
   Cider Mill Restaurant 
   6712 SW Capitol Hwy, Portland, OR 97219
   Phone: (503) 246-7737

What To expect
===================

We generally rotate leading songs.   
The song leader (who is usally the singer) will announce the song, its key, and we'll post the chords.
Everyone is welcome to play on every song.   If the song is suitable for solos, the song leader will call 
out the first soloist and we generally cycle around the room giving each soloist a chance to strut their stuff.
It is perfectly fine to lead a song that you just want to hear
(as long as you go recruit a singer to actually sing it.




Volume Control
===================

The only musical requirement we enforce is that you watch your volume.   This is meant to be a collaborative
environment and you should always be able to hear the singer and all the instruments.   In particular, 
during a round of solos, we want to bring the volume all the way down so the soloist can shine.

The second piece of volume control is avoiding noodling in the break between songs.   The Cider Mill has all 
background noise you expect in a working restaurant and it's hard to communicate the title, key and tempo of
of the next song if everyone is playing in the breaks.

We have billed this as an acoustic jam.   There are, of course, some instruments which cannot be played without
an amplifier of some sort (keyboards is an obvious case).   If you have an instrument which absolutely needs
amplification, please contact bobjcondon@gmail.com and will see how we can best accomodate you.


Chords
=======

We display the cords (and often the lyrics) for each song as we play it.  The two exceptions to this
are a 12-bar blues and a 12-bar blues with a quick change.  
See https://happybluesman.com/common-variations-12-bar-blues/ for a detailed explanation.   If this is 
new to you, don't worry, we'll get someone to call the chords out to you until you get the hang of it.


We have 3 methods we use to display chords.   Whatever method you use to display chords for your song,
please remember that, while the song will be well known by you, it will be new to some of the players
in the room.   It helps every out if the song is marked out in measures (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLAIgfnkk4c)

So while you *could* capture the chord changes in a 12-bar blues as::

    G C G D C G 


it is a lot kinder to write one chord per measure (using % ) to indicate a repeated chord::

   G % % %
   C % G %
   D C G %

Old School whiteboard
----------------------

If you want to lead a song we don't have in another format, you can write it on the white board.   


The BSteele app
----------------

Bob Steele has written a app http://www.bsteele.com/bsteeleMusicApp/#mainList used by Portland Community Jams (https://communityjams.org/)
We have the capability to display it on the televisions at the Cider Mill. It has a large collection of songs as recorded in the original key.   It has the big advantage that all the songs can be 
transposed to match a singer's vocal range.   The viewer is set up to make it easy to scroll through each section (although doing so puts a bit of 
a burden on the computer operator) If there is non-trivial song you would like to try, check if it's in this library.

Shared Google docs drive
------------------------

The directory https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B8yJcBO9yHHOSFlkcHBqN2Jpblk?resourcekey=0-ju-vVN34fL-3bMmT-SPg3g&usp=sharing
has a library of google docs which have been editted to be visible without scrolling on the screen.   They cannot be tranposed however.
